Most mortgages require a 20% down payment, and that amount can save you money in the long term. But if youâ€™re a first-time buyer, you can qualify for mortgages that require as little as 3% down. Just be sure you understand any additional costs, such as private mortgage insurance (called PMI), before you put down less than 20%. You may be better off delaying the purchase so you can save more.""",
